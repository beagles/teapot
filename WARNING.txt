WARNING: running any of these tools might overwrite something or remove
something you didn't want "gone". Read this before monkeying around. Most
notably if you have VMs in your devstack environment or networks other than
the two "default" devstack ones, running these scripts will obliterate
them. You've been warned.

You should probably read README.txt too. If you had already you've already
seen this warning.
